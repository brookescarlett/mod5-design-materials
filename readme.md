# Introduction to UX/UI Design
Welcome to Mod 5! Making an app from scratch is one of the most exciting parts of the program, but it's often hard to know where to start when it comes to designing it. So here we are! This is an introduction to the fundamentals of user experience and user interface design. These materials are here to help inform your design decisions as your apps come to life. 

Think of this as a crash course in web design; a 101 to help render your app's functionality as more accessible to users through visual language.

* We'll start with an exploration of all of the topics above. In addition, the labs will offer you some best practices; rules you can follow as you think through the design of your app. Then, we'll provide you with some online tools you can utilize as you start thinking about implementation, as well as resources to read/watch if you want to take a deeper dive into any of the topics.
* This material is designed to help you think about design in ways you may not have previously. The aim is to show you how you can use design thinking, research, color and type to enhance the work you're already doing.
