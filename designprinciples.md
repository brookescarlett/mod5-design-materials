# Design Principles 
It’s often said that good design is all around us, but because it works with our understanding of a product, a service or a platform that it is often invisible, and in a lot of aspects that’s true. When done correctly, good design should solve for problems, speak to the brand of the platform and be unobtrusive. While a lot of people can speak to good design, implementing design can be a tricky and time-consuming labor of love. Supposing that you have all of the content necessary for your designs and they’ve been audited down to patterns that have been validated by usability testing, adhering to these principles will guarantee a positive return. 

### Principles of Good Design
* Aesthetics: is it beautiful? Is it pleasing to the eye?
* Utility: is it useful? Does it solve a need?
* Ease-of-use: is it intuitive? Is it user-friendly?
* Innovation: is it cutting-edge? Is it novel?
* Enduring: is it timeless? Will it last?
* Unobtrusive: Is it transparent? Is it unintrusive?
* Honest: Is the product upfront and clear about its message?
* Thorough: Is it detail-oriented? Is every aspect of the design accurate and complete?
* Environmentally-friendly: Does it conserve resources?
* Minimalist: Is it focused on just the essentials? Is it simple?
