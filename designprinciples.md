# Design Principles 
It’s often said that good design is all around us, but because it works with our understanding of a product, a service or a platform that it is often invisible, and in a lot of aspects that’s true. When done correctly, good design should solve for problems, speak to the brand of the platform and be unobtrusive. While a lot of people can speak to good design, implementing design can be a tricky and time-consuming labor of love. Supposing that you have all of the content necessary for your designs and they’ve been audited down to patterns that have been validated by usability testing, adhering to these principles will guarantee a positive return.

* Aesthetics: is it beautiful? Is it pleasing to the eye?
* Utility: is it useful? Does it solve a need?
* Ease-of-use: is it intuitive? Is it user-friendly?
* Innovation: is it cutting-edge? Is it novel?
* Enduring: is it timeless? Will it last?
* Unobtrusive: Is it transparent? Is it unintrusive?
* Honest: Is the product upfront and clear about its message?
* Thorough: Is it detail-oriented? Is every aspect of the design accurate and complete?
* Environmentally-friendly: Does it conserve resources?
* Minimalist: Is it focused on just the essentials? Is it simple?

### Observing Bad Design

* Example: [Updoots](http://updoots.com/)
* Why it's poorly designed: 
    * On first glance, it’s hard to tell what this is.
    * The logo doesn’t speak to the brand.
    * There’s no logical hierarchy of content
    * There’s no division of slides content is everywhere
    * Blocks or text are center aligned which drives down scannability.

* Example: [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)
* Why it's well designed: 
    * It’s clear what the product does.
    * The logo and navigation up top are legible and stand out from the content below. 
    * There’s consistent brand language (fonts, colors, and imagery). 
    * Content is clearly divided into readable chunks with sufficient whitespace to guide the user’s eye to specific actions.
