# Applying Design Thinking to Visual Design
Prior to starting any project, the designer/developer in charge must ask themselves the following questions:

1. Who is the audience?
    * Understanding your audience is crucial to building any platform. Following the [user-centered design](http://www.usabilityfirst.com/about-usability/introduction-to-user-centered-design/) approach will not only guarantee an audience and direction but when used in conjunction with [design thinking](https://www.creativityatwork.com/design-thinking-strategy-for-innovation/), will de-risk your platform and establish a strong foundation to build off of.
    * Did you inherit a [persona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=11&v=y1oWPkoe4yU) from a [UX](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/what-is-ux-design-15-user-experience-experts-weigh-in/) team? Having a validated persona or [design principles](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2018/05/7-ux-principles-for-creating-a-great-website/) will be your guiding light towards making better design decisions. 
2. What platforms are your users familiar with?
    * This will allow us to build around a user’s [mental model](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/) so we don’t use bad [Information Architecture](https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/complete-beginners-guide-to-information-architecture/) and risk our platform. 
3. What is the platform? (Is it heavy in media content like Netflix or Spotify? Is it an educational platform?)
    * Understanding your platform provides guidelines and helps you understand both the goals of the platform and the constraints. For example, certain platforms work well with a dark interface while others need more whitespace. When creating a website or app, content is key to understanding how to build your layout. Are we using a lot of text? Will there be a lot of marketing materials? Do I need to work within a pre-existing style guide?
4. What's the [competitive landscape](http://www.ignytebrands.com/how-to-do-a-knockout-competitive-brand-audit/) like? How are other brands in the space making use of colors, type, photos? 
    * Understanding how other brands make design choices can help inform the way we think about design ourselves.
