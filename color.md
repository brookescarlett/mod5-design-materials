# Color 
Learning how to use color is an important skill set for every designer. Color theory focuses on the color wheel, color harmony, and its application to accomplish a specific goal. With the right colors, you can set a mood, attract attention, or create a signature brand. Color can be used to energize a page or to create a sense of calm. With color, you can provide a visual understanding of your platform and guide userâ€™s to take specific actions on your screens.  

### Best Practices 
* Start with one color and work within a [monochromatic](https://designshack.net/articles/inspiration/monochromatic-color-how-to-use-it-effectively/) color scheme.
