# Typography
At its core, typography i is a set of geometric and organic shapes to form letters. When used in digital design, most people think of typography as headers, subheaders and body copy, but typography is more than that. When used correctly, the anatomy of a type can help establish a brand, a tone or feeling, and of course for practical purposes, communicates words and phrases. While some typography is decorative or abstract, typography is a great way to create a cohesive design vision.

### Best Practices 
* When choosing a typeface, think about its intended use and always strive for readability. 
* For mobile: no more than two typefaces (header and body copy)
* For desktop: no more than three typefaces (one for the header, one for the subheader and one for the body copy)
* Start with one typeface that has various weights and use that to show hierarchy.
	Example: Avenir
* For body copy, keep text over three lines left aligned to increase scannability. 
* For mobile, find typefaces that pair well with machine fonts. 
    * I.e., [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) (iOS) and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) (Android)
